---

Our API allows you to submit out-of-network claims to vision insurers. Please note that VSP is the only vision insurer that supports Assignment of Benefits (AOB). All other insurers will send reimbursement directly to the patient. 

Typically, reimbursements are processed within 2-4 weeks from submission and will be sent via paper mail. Unfortunately, we don’t have a reliable way to track the status of your claims once they’re submitted.

While we strive to provide accurate estimates for patient eligibility, coverage, and reimbursement, we cannot guarantee these details or ensure payments to you. Eligibility and payment will be confirmed when the insurer processes the claim. Our coverage estimates are usually accurate, but there may be occasional discrepancies. We recommend informing your patients that their actual reimbursement may vary slightly from the initial estimate.

You can technically submit claims without checking a patient's eligibility, but we don't recommend it. This will result in an increased number of rejected claims.
