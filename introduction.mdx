The Anagram API enables you to integrate vision insurance eligibility checks, benefit retrieval, claim submissions, and other processes into your healthcare application. It provides RESTful endpoints to interact with various services such as patient eligibility, claims, and integration with the Anagram app.

## Use Cases

The Anagram API supports a range of use cases designed to accommodate various business models and workflows. Whether you operate entirely online, combine online and in-store experiences, or run a brick-and-mortar location, the API provides flexible integrations for eligibility checks, claims processing, and patient management.

### Online Retail

The Anagram API streamlines the patient shopping experience in a fully digital environment by automatically handling eligibility verification, benefit interpretation, and claims submission. Customers can check their eligibility for vision plans while shopping, get real-time coverage estimates, and submit out-of-network claims upon checkout. This approach offers patients and online retailers a seamless, hands-off experience without human intervention.

### Hybrid API and Anagram App

Sometimes, you may prefer to send patient information and eligibility requests automatically via the API but manage the complex benefit interpretation and claim submission process in the Anagram App. Anagram's App has a rich plan interpretation and claim submission experience that makes it easy for your staff and doesn't require you to build out custom workflows.

Some examples of this use case:

1. Sending patients and eligibility requests directly via the API from the PM schedule 24-48 hours before patient appointments. When staff log in, the patient information, including eligibility, is already there waiting for them.
2. Sending the patient and eligibility request data directly from the PM system upon request from a staff member. This reduces double entry. Staff continue the benefit interpretation and claim submission in the Anagram App.
3. Running batch eligibility checks for a group of patients
