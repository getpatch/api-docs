title: "Eligibility Request"
openapi: "POST /api/auth/v1/eligibility/"
description: "Initiating an eligibility check for a patient"
---

This call is asynchronous, it initiates an eligibility search and returns a UID assigned to this request. The result will be returned in two ways:

- Via active [webhooks](https://provider.anagram.care/webhooks) once available - preferred. Request UID will be included in payload.
- By calling the "Eligibility Result" endpoint - only to be used as fallback. Request UID is required.

If specifying a UID, ensure it is unique. If omitted, one will be generated automatically and included in the response for this API call.

The response will contain the request UID or a validation error.
