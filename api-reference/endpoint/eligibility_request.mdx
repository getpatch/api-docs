title: "Eligibility Request"
openapi: "POST /api/auth/v1/eligibility/"
description: "Initiating an eligibility check for a patient"
---

Requesting a patient's eligibility uses the following parameters:

- First name (required)
- Last name (required)
- Date of birth (required)
- Last four digits from SSN (optional)
- Zip code (optional)
- Insurer Member ID (optional)
- Request UID (optional)

This call is asynchronous, it initiates an eligibility search and returns a UID assigned to this request. The result will be returned in two ways:

- Via active [webhooks](https://provider.anagram.care/webhooks) once available - preferred. Request UID will be included in payload.
- By calling the "Eligibility Result" endpoint - only to be used as fallback. Request UID is required.

If specifying a UID, ensure it is unique. If omitted, one will be generated automatically and included in the response for this API call.

Authentication is required for this endpoint. The API key can be obtained in the[ app](https://provider.anagram.care/). The API key must be sent in the `Authorization` header, prefaced with `Api `:

`Authorization: Api <your api key>`

The response will contain the request UID or a validation error.
