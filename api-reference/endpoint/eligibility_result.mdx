The Eligibility request result will be sent to all active webhooks once available. As a fallback, you may call this endpoint to check result status and obtain the result.

### Status

The `status` field in the response can have one of the following values:

| Status Code  | Details                                                                                                     |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `complete`   | Indicates that the search has been completed.                                                               |
| `processing` | Signifies that the search is currently in progress, and it is recommended to retry the request later.       |
| `error`      | Suggests that the search dit not finished successfully, and you can find descriptions of error codes below. |

### Error codes

| Error code         | Details                                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `insurer_problem`  | Insurer not available, try again later |
| `unexpected_error` | Unknown error                          |

### Webhooks

Add webhooks to receive results in the [provider app](https://provider.anagram.care/webhooks). Webhook payload will be identical to the response of this endpoint.

When configuring a webhook you can provide a secret to sign the webhook payload and check the signature on the server side.

Signature will be sent in `X-Signature` header in request to webhook endpoint.

Signature is a request raw data signed with secret by HMAC SHA256 algorithm. Python example:

```python
import hashlib
import hmac

def get_signature(secret_key: str, payload: str) -> str:
    return hmac.new(secret_key.encode(), payload.encode(), hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
```
