The V2 endpoint expands on V1 by returning comprehensive in-network benefit details, including coinsurance, allowances, and additional coverage information.

## Flags

Benefits and benefit properties might be context-dependent, which is indicated by flags. When flags are not specified, the benefit or property is always applicable. Child benefits inherit the flag-dependent properties of parent benefits.

- `inn` — benefit or property is applicable only in-network
- `oon` — benefit or property is applicable only out-of-network
- `exclusive-use` — only one benefit of the same level can be used per policy year
- `required` — benefit is required to be used for the parent benefit to kick in
- `requires-parent-use` — benefit can be used if the parent benefit is not already used
