There is no testing environment. For testing, use the `insurer:vision:demo` payer in the **insurer_code** request parameter. This demo payer provides mock responses and does not interact with live data.

## Cheat Codes

For testing purposes, you can include cheat codes in the **Eligibility Request**. Cheat codes can be provided in the fields `first_name`, `last_name`, and `member_id`. Here are some examples of cheat codes:

- `mark_used`: This cheat code marks all benefits as used.
- `dt_exam_used`: This cheat code marks exam benefit as used.
- `no_oon`: Removes all out-of-network benefits from the plan.
- `no_inn`: Removes all in-network benefits from the plan. You can use both `no_oon` and `no_inn` codes together to generate a plan without any benefits.
- `delay_10`, `delay_30`: These codes introduce a delay in the response, causing it to wait for either 10 or 30 seconds before providing an answer.
- `big_family`: This cheat code adds multiple persons to the result.
- `not_found`: Using this cheat code will delete all results.
- `in_err_int`: This cheat code simulates a problem and triggers the `unexpected_error` during initial eligibility check step.
- `dt_err_int`: This cheat code simulates a problem on a plan details request stage and triggers the `unexpected_error`.
- `gen_all.in_pii`: Populates all possible person's fields in the eligibility result. This can be useful to test that your app can utilize all person field variants.
- `in_noact.dt_all_inactive`: Removes `is_active` flag from a person level on the initial request and makes [plan details request](/api-reference/endpoint/eligibility_details_request) to reveal that the plan is inactive.
