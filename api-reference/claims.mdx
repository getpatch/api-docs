The claim object contains all the information required to send a claim to an insurer:

* insurer

* patient details

* primary member details (can be same as patient details)

* list of services

Note that although the VSP claim form allows arbitrary CPS/HCPCS codes and our API supports the majority of them, we recommend using only the codes specified below to reduce the chance of claim rejection. Contact Anagram customer support if you need to use other codes.

During claim submission the API validates the claim payload against known insurer requirements and will reject a claim that we know will be rejected by the insurer. However, this does not guarantee the opposite; a claim accepted by the API can still be rejected by the insurer.

It is possible for insurers to change their requirements without notifying us. In these events as soon as we understand the new requirements we will update the validation rules and notify you. It is advizable to be prepared to adopt the updated rules as quickly as possible.

## Object types

The main fields of claim are:

* `patient`: JSON object, representing patient details

* `primary_member`: JSON object, representing primary patient member

* `services`: list of JSON objects, representing services that can be reimbursed

Also, there are fields in nested objects:

* `address`: JSON object, represents the mailing address in `patient` and `primary_member` fields.

Both `patient` and `primary_member` must be provided even if claim is created for a primary member. In this case, both the `patient` object and `primary_member` object must contain the same data.

### `address` (object)

Mailing address:

| Field name | Field type | Constraints | Description         | Examples                   |                            |

`    `**`"line2"`**`: `**`null`**`,`
`    `**`"state"`**`: "CA",`
`    `**`"zipcode"`**`: "12332"`
`}`

### `services` (list of objects)

The services (and materials) received by the patient are a list of service objects. Each service object has a type that must be described by a valid CPT/HCPCS code (see "CPT/HCPC codes" for the full list of available codes).

Note that diagnosis codes can be supplied both as global diagnosis (via top-level `diagnosis_codes` field) or per service, via an optional `diagnosis_codes` field in the service object.

| date             | `date`      |                   | date of service                     | `2022-08-12` |   |

Unknown codes will result in an error.

### `primary_member` object

This object contains information about the primary member on the insurance plan. In most cases, the primary member will also be the patient.
